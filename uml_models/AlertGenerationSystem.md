The Alert Generation System diagram models how the CHMS handles real-time alerts for patient data. I designed it to evaluate data, create alerts, and send them to medical staff. The `AlertGenerator` class is the main part, it takes `PatientData` (like heart rate) and checks it against a `Threshold` for each patient. The `Threshold` class holds rules, like a maximum heart rate of 130, so each patient can have their own limits. If the data goes over the limit, `AlertGenerator` makes an `Alert` with the patient ID, the problem (like “HeartRate too high”), and the time.

The `Alert` class stores this information, and the `AlertManager` takes the alerts and sends them to the staff. I added a `PatientIdentifier` class to make sure alerts include the patient’s name, linking to the patient identification system. The `PatientData` class connects to the data storage system, holding one piece of data at a time, like a heart rate of 135.

I made the system modular by splitting tasks: `AlertGenerator` only checks data, `AlertManager` only sends alerts, and `PatientIdentifier` handles patient details. This keeps each class focused on one job, which makes the system easier to change later. For example, if we need a new way to send alerts, we only change `AlertManager`. I also used associations to show how classes work together, like `AlertGenerator` using many `Threshold` objects. The access rules make sure sensitive data, like patient names, is only used where needed, keeping the system secure. This design helps the CHMS alert staff quickly and safely when a patient’s health data shows a problem.
