The Data Access Layer diagram shows how the CHMS gets data from the signal generator. I made an interface called `DataListener` with methods to start and stop listening for data. Three classes use this interface: `TCPDataListener`, `WebSocketDataListener`, and `FileDataListener`. They get data from TCP, WebSocket, or files, using a port number or file path.

The `DataParser` class takes the raw data, like a string, and turns it into a `PatientData` object that the system can use. The `DataSourceAdapter` class then sends this data to the storage system. I used an interface so we can add new ways to get data later, like from a new source, without changing the whole system.

The relationships show that each listener class follows the `DataListener` interface, and `DataListener` uses `DataParser` to turn data into objects and `DataSourceAdapter` to send it to storage. Each class has one job: the listeners get data, `DataParser` changes it, and `DataSourceAdapter` sends it. This keeps the system separate from how the data comes in, making it easier to change later. The access rules make sure the listeners only talk to `DataParser` and `DataSourceAdapter`, keeping the data flow clear.
