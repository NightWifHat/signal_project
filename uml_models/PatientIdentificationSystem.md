The Patient Identification System diagram shows how the CHMS links data to the right patient. The `PatientIdentifier` class takes a patient ID and finds the matching record by using the `IdentityManager`. The `PatientRecord` class holds details like the patient ID, name, and medical history, which come from the hospital database.

The `IdentityManager` class keeps all patient records in a map and handles problems, like if a patient ID does not match any record. It can add new records and log mismatches when they happen. I made `IdentityManager` the main class to control records, so `PatientIdentifier` only asks it for data. This keeps the system organized.

The relationships show that `PatientIdentifier` uses one `IdentityManager`, and `IdentityManager` manages many `PatientRecord` objects. I kept the classes simple, with each doing one job: `PatientIdentifier` matches IDs, `PatientRecord` stores data, and `IdentityManager` oversees everything. This makes the system easy to change, like adding new ways to handle mismatches. The access rules make sure only `IdentityManager` can change records, keeping patient data safe. This design helps the CHMS match data to patients correctly and handle errors when a match fails.
