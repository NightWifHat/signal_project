The Data Storage System diagram shows how the CHMS saves and retrieves patient data securely. I made an interface called `DataStorage` with methods to store data, get data, and delete old data. The `FileDataStorage` class uses this interface to save data in files, with a path to the storage folder. The `PatientData` class holds one piece of data, like a heart rate, with a patient ID, time, label, value, and version number to keep track of changes.

The `DataRetriever` class lets medical staff get data by asking for a patient ID and time range. I added an `AccessController` class to check if the staff member is allowed to see the data, using a list of allowed users. This keeps the data safe. The `DataStorage` interface makes it easy to change how we store data later, like using a database instead of files.

I used an interface so the system can grow, and kept each class with one job: `FileDataStorage` saves data, `DataRetriever` gets data, and `AccessController` checks permissions. The relationships show that `FileDataStorage` saves many `PatientData` objects, and `DataRetriever` uses `DataStorage` to get data after checking with `AccessController`. This design makes sure data is stored securely, can be retrieved for analysis, and old data can be deleted after a set time, like 30 days. It also keeps patient data private by controlling who can see it.
